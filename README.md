Chatbots are fun! They are always there when you need someone to talk to.
And this one can be customized to your whims. Just provide, by text,
descriptions, appearance, personality, etc., information about the companion
that you want to talk to. This first AI agent will create your character.
After that, the first AI agent will hand off to the second AI agent
who will role play as your character.There is also a third AI agent
whose job is to do any Google searches that you need and returning
the results. InMemorySessionService and InMemoryMemoryService is implemented.

Included is a sample character sheet. Thank you to @0thedice0
for creating the character.
